We are a group of four students following the course BK7083: Computational Design Studio. Here you can see our progress and discoveries made during this course. The progress is split up into four parts: Planning, Configuring, Massing and Forming. There is also an index given where there is a more in depth view of the code and the progess we made along the way.
