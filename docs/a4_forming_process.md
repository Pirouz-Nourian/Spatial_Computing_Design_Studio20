#### Modularity
Keeping with our main goal of creating a sustainable and modular system, we designed individual voxels as spatial modules that can be interconnected to create spaces with different programs. We aimed for a designed which chould be easily adapted if and when the buiding had to change, meaning modules could be added or removed or their function could be easily changed.

#### Modular system
The system consists of 4 parts: the permanent structure and the adaptable facade and infill.

#### Flexible tiling 
The facade tiles are designed to tile vertically and create patterns. Whenever new modules would be added to the structure, new tiles from different tile set could be used for each new addition. This way the building facade would enrich over time. It is another way to emphasize the buildingâ€™s adaptability and long lifecycle.
