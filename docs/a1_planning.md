#### The design problems

The objective for this course was to develop and create housing, work and recreational spaces. This has to be done in a way that is both beneficial to the users and neigbouring community, while also taking sustainablity into account. 

#### Programme of requirements

The design brief states that the plot in [Rotterdam, The block between Vijverhofstraat, Zomerhofstraat, Schoterbosstraat, and Teilingerstraat](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Startup+Noord/@51.9292516,4.4767546,373m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c434a9cf625753:0xb8615a4c444b9d57!8m2!3d51.9292516!4d4.4779013) is to be redeveloped. Here we could choose between the compulsory or optional plot as shown in the figure below. 

![the Plot](../img/plot.png)

The brief given could be alterted to some extend, so we changed it to the following:

- Housing:
    - Student housing 80 units
    - Assisted living 30 units
    - Starter housing 100 units

- Communal Spaces:
    - Underground parking (0.5 parking lots per apartment or more)
    - Communal garden
    - Workshop
    - Common room (co-cooking)
    - Study space
    - Bike parking (1 per resident)

- Public Spaces:
    - Shared car parking
    - Hub
    - Community center
    - Librairy and music rooms
    - Offices
    - Gym
    - Makerspace
    - Shop(s)
    - Coffee corner
    - Restaurant(s)
    - Bike parking 

#### Networking
In order to start designing the building we started by creating topological network diagrams of the to be realised building. 
They took many shapes to begin with but after some time we setteled on 
[this one](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lfSaOlk=/).

The idea being that the residents are centered around a more quiet and peacefull garden, while the more public functions are centered around the hub.
