# Process of massing

For generating the building, a concatenation of code is needed. To visualize this, a flowchart is generated visualizing the final configuration process, showing all steps and connections.

*configuration flowchart* 

This process has four main steps: 
1.	The calculation of the voxel values 
2.	The selection of the aailable envelope
3.	The placement of all functions in the envelope with the growth model 
4.	The polygonization of the façade

The first three steps are being explained on this page, whereas the elaboration on the polygonization is written in the massing process page. 
The order of all explanations will follow the order in the flowchart.
