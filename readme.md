This is a project repository of Minor Spatial Computing 2020-2021, project group 1. The mid-term and Final submission's process, final products and underlying code/input can be found in this repository. 

## Folder Structure
The documentation is divided in 4 phases:
```html
* A1_Planning: 
    Preliminary spatial analysis on the site and idea proposal regarding design goals.
    (KPI, Program of Requirements, Diagrams) with the starting point as described 
    in this home page as input. 


* A2_Configuring:
    Setting up the plot, determining voxel size. In principle, formulating the 
    spatial concept of the building.
    (Lattice contruction and determining voxelsize)

* A3_Massing:
    Computing envelopes and using those in order to logically place functional spaces 
    and form shafts and corridors. After this, allowing the spaces to grow with the 
    given criterias. 
    (Spatial Analysis, Corridors and Shafts, Designing the lattice with voxel 
    removal and ABM growth)

    
* A4_Forming:
    Finalizing the results with polygonization and designing the borders of the voxels. 
    (Polygonization and renders)

```
