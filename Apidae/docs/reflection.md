### Result 
Even though our result may not be perfect, it is a good step in the right direction of a better design method. We realize that finishing our project would perhaps have taken a couple years, but we believe that using this method is a great improvement as apposed to the method we were used to. 

### Group process
Our different personalities and beliefs made us as a group very critical towards each other. This made us have long and deep arguments over certain choices that had to be made, which made us even more convinced of the decisions made. Our different personalities and roles in the group complemented each other really well. We discussed the things we wanted to do and achieve with the specific scripts and then someone became  an “expert” for that specific script. This gave each of us more time to dig deeper into the code of a certain script and ultimately made us more understanding of the code. 

### Teachers
We would like to express our thankfulness to Pirouz Nourian, Shervin Azadi and Hans Hoogenboom as they have guided as through this amazing adventure. They have brought us inspiration and knowledge we will carry with us through the rest of our life. They have showed us that architecture can be progressive, efficient, scientific in an extremely fun and exciting way. This course surely wasn't easy, but definitely worth it.
