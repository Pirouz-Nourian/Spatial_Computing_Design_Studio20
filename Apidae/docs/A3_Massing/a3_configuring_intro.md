# Process of massing

For generating the building, a concatenation of code is needed. To visualize this, a flowchart is generated visualizing the final configuration process, showing all steps and connections. 

*you can zoom in on the flowchart with the bar below that appears when hovering over the diagram*

This process has four main steps: 
1.	The calculation of the voxel values 
2.	The selection of the aailable envelope
3.	The placement of all functions in the envelope with the growth model 
4.	The polygonization of the fa√ßade

The first three steps are being explained on this page, whereas the elaboration on the polygonization is written in the massing process page. 
The order of all explanations will follow the order in the flowchart.
