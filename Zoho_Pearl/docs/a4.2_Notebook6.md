&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following script will load the previously stored [sound data](https://miloumulder.github.io/spatial_computing_project_template/a4.2_Notebook5/) files and scale them so they for a proper sound lattice.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>First, the script iterates over the different files in data/sound and adds those to a list. Then a scalar is established and the whole list is stored, reshaped and exported into a CSV.

##Flowchart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowchart as shown in *[Figure 47](img/flowcharts/06_scale_sound.jpg)* is in the second (blue) section of the [fundamental flowchart](img/flowcharts/flowchart cuts.png) as shown in the [*Planning - products*](https://miloumulder.github.io/spatial_computing_project_template/a1.1_Product/#fundamental-flowchartt).

## Pseudo code 
This is the Pseudo code for [Notebook 6](notebooks/06_scale_sound.ipynb).

```Python
#Load the complete lattice
create a base list of zeroes in same shape as complete lattice

for each sound file in 'data/sound'
    Unpickle and save to sound list

#Use the sound list with [x, y, z, val] to make a sound lattice with only val
for each voxel in sound list
    base list[x, y, z] = sound value

#Scalar so max = 1.0 and min = 0.0
scalar = max - min

#Scaling the sound value
for each voxel in base list
    if val != 0
        val -= min
        val /= scalar

#Export sound lattice
Export sound lattice to 'sound_3_6.csv'
```
