&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the generation of the agent based design the following [matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTXQ7xN6Oc80H7ovOIW-T_XuTy-P3YVa4lM9-Nyhjp6YincE2vTo0UpYqls-JCI2A/pubhtml?gid=1743851868&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false) has been made based on the agent criterias, this has been used in the definitive script. As you can see, we have focused on the following aspects: the connection between the spaces and the different entrances, the sun access, Roof access, the silent level active (which means how little noise the facilities produce) and the noise sensitivity (which we will use for both the internal and external noise). *Space area* means the estimated amount of voxels (3,6m x 3,6m x 3,6m) each function needs and with the column initial location we manually indicate the specific position for the entrances.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrances that we have determined are shown in *[Figure 53](img/3/3_entrance_sketch.jpg)*. The most public entrances have been placed on the most busy road (Vijverhofstraat). These are the entrances for the atrium, supermarket and cinema, arcade and caf√©/restaurant/pub. The entrances to the courtyard and the atrium carry contrasting functions of public and private. Nevertheless, we want these spaces to have a strong connection which is simulated by placing them opposite of each other, whereby the entrance of the courtyard is situated at the more peaceful side, namely the north east side along the *Schoterbosstraat*. Subsequently the public library is situated at *Teilingerstraat* and the car parking at *Zomerhofstraat*. Both streets that are less busy than *Vijverhofstraat*, but are situated close to other the public entrances that have been appointed above.  And lastly, the trash room is placed on the *Teilingerstraat*. In addition, sound pollution, produced by the internal spaces inside the building as well as the sound pollution produced by the outdoors traffic, has been taken into account when the entrances were placed. The placement of the entrances divide the building into a sound producing side and a more quiet side.

###Additional diagrams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following diagrams we will zoom in on each criteria where the main steps have been visualized and are explained.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Diagram Closeness](img/3/3_closeness.jpg): The location of the seed agents is calculated randomly. When the initial location has been determined the different seed agents will be attracted to each other, based on the closeness matrix. The seed agents will eventually grow towards the attracted seed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Diagram Entrances](img/3/3_entrances.jpg): The specific initial location of the entrances have been chosen manually, based on the entrance map. When the initial location is calculated randomly and is placed it will grow towards the attracted entrance seed, based on entrance accessibility matrix.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Diagram Floor preference](img/3/3_floorpreference.jpg): A column of the building will be cut out and will get a range of distance values. When the initial location has been determined the different seed agents will be attracted to their desired floor preference, based on the floor preference matrix. The only floors that are preferred are 1 and 0 or nothing. The seed agents will grow towards the attracted floor preference.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Diagram Internal noise](img/3/3_internal_noise.jpg): The location of the seed agents is calculated randomly. The amount of silence the agents produce will be calculated and will be compared to the noise sensitivity property. The agents that are sensitive for noise will grow away from the agents that create a lot of noise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Diagram External noise](img/3/3_external_noise.png): The amount of external noise around the building will be determined.The location of the seed agents is calculated randomly. When the initial location has been determined the noise sensitivity property, from the matrix will be compared to the external noise values. The agents that are sensitive to noise will grow away from the noisy facades.

### Reflexion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end result of the growing model is not exactly the desired building configuration. The building is quite wide and as a consequence, a lot of spaces experience little light. In addition, many spaces have been placed in unsuitable positions, as for example the supermarket that has a height of five floors. Furthermore, some functions even got sliced into multiple clusters, for instance, the cinema was split into three separate parts on some floors. In all probability, these mistakes happened due to a few oversights that went unsolved owing to a lack of time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, an implementation that would help to solve these problems, is the optimized choice of initial locations. The current script defines the initial location of the agents randomly, therefore agents can end up in wrong positions far away from their desired location. Secondly, the criteria squareness can be implemented, which will ensure agents grow into their desired shape. This could be rectangular or free form. And lastly, if the growing model would have fewer voxels to grow, the agents could fulfill their preferences more. As a result, the building would not be as wide and the spaces would receive more sunlight.
