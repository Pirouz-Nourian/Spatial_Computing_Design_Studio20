&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the following script, the voxelized envelope, as created in [Notebook 1](https://miloumulder.github.io/spatial_computing_project_template/a2.2_Notebook1/), will be optimized in regards to its shadow footprint or solar envelope. In the first part of this script, the logic is set up to use ladybug and trimesh to shoot rays both from the different sun positions towards the voxels and inverse from voxels towards sun positions.

##Flowchart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowchart as shown in *[Figure 25](img/flowcharts/02_solar_envelope.jpg)* is in the first (purple) section of the [fundamental flowchart](img/flowcharts/flowchart cuts.png) as shown in the [*Planning - products*](https://miloumulder.github.io/spatial_computing_project_template/a1.1_Product/#fundamental-flowchart).

## Additional diagrams
 <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a Solar access calculation is done with vectors from suns towards the voxels. If these rays intersect with the context mesh they are set to 0. 
 <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly and more importantly, a solar envelope calculation is done by shooting rays from the voxels towards the sun. Then this list of rays is compared with the list from solar access. [Figure 27](img/overige/solar_envelope_1.jpg) visualizes how the logic behind the solar envelope works. When an intersection is found at place 2, a shadow is cast on the context. It is important to establish whether this shadow was cast by the voxel or by the context. For this, we use the comparison with the solar access list. If an intersection is found at 1, the shadow is cast by the context. For a ray to count towards the solar envelope of a voxel, an intersection needs to be found at 2 and not at 1.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the solar analysis is done, the list of voxels is split, using a low and high bound threshold value. A threefold of lattices are established in this step: Voxels to recalculate, voxels to keep and voxels to remove. As you can see in [Figure 28](img/overige/solar_envelope_2.jpg), the red top part would be removed, the blue recalculated and the green kept.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resolution of these lattices are increased to a desired size. In our case one voxel is split into 8 smaller voxels, this is called an Octree system. This whole process can be seen as Pass 1. With the recalculation lattice, the process is repeated until, in our case, the voxel size is 3,6. A total of three passes were needed. 
Each pass is individually exported a CSV or pickled into a txt file.

## Pseudo code 
This is the Pseudo code for [Notebook 2](notebooks/02_solar_envelope.ipynb).

```Python
#Import envelope mesh and context mesh
envelope_mesh = envelope.stl
context_mesh = extended_context_reduced.stl

#Visualize meshes with pyvista

#Import lattice
On first pass lattice = lattice_14_4.csv
On subsequent passes lattice = lattice_continue.csv

#Visualize lattice with pyvista

#Define Sunpath
Choose day_multiple carefully, between 15 and 75
Compute the sun_vectors to shoot
Visualize suns with pyvista

#Compute intersections
Create two seperate lists for ray direction for envelope and access
Check the number of rays carefully, should definetly be under 120k and ideally under 100k

Compute the intersections for solar_acces
Compute the intersections for solar_envelope

#Aggregate Simulation results
Translate list of rays with 1 or 0 on hit or miss to a value per voxel.
For solar envelope check if shadow is not cast by context by comparing the acces and envelope lists

#Save solar information to an array
Iterate over each voxel and add its solar acces and envelope value
